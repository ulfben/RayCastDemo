Revision 0: 
- initalize SDL2 (window, renderer and inputs)
- copy-paste the original Ray.cpp
- write a facade to translate between the original dependencies and SDL: 
--- Eg: _moveto, _lineto, _setcolor, _drawrect, getch, clear
--- ignoring: _settextposition and drawing text on screen (let's keep it simple)
- delete dead code (Timer), replace all far*-types and _fmalloc-calls
- replace original level loading- and parsing with an inline constexpr array
- rename original "main" to "run"
- add SDL_RenderPresent() & SDL_Delay() to the main loop
- Fix OG bug: move map drawing into the main loop so it's not lost on updates.
+ the movement code is buggy (can't move)
+ using _getch means you have to focus the console window to control the app, but otherwise we're in business. 

It compiles, runs and renders. Time to start refactoring!
